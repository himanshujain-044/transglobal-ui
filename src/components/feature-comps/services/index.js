            Hydrogen is widely used in refining processes to remove impurities
            found in crude oil such as sulfur to meet stringent product and
            environmental specifications. Removing these components allows
            gasoline and diesel to burn cleaner and thus makes hydrogen a
            critical component in the production of cleaner fuels needed by
            efficient internal combustion engines.

            Oxygen enrichment can help increase capacity or give refiners the
            ability to process crude blends of various densities and sulfur
            content.

            Nitrogen does not react with most materials, making it an excellent
            blanketing and purging gas that can be used to protect valuable
            products from harmful contaminants.
